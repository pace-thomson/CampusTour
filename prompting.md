# For those long prompts and stuff

This project is for a Campus tour app and supporting services that I am building for my Univserity, but it will be for many schools. I am in the middle of building it at the moment, and I need your help. You can find all the overaching documentation for this project in NOTDOCS. I am in the process of handling the ambassador-led tour part of this product. The next part I need to accomplish this is a websocket managed tour that works by the ambassador leading the tour from their phone. I have already handled logging in and account management (both in the webapp and mobile app portion of this project). I am now ready to handle the websocket management of tour sessions. Could you read through this project, particularly the mobile app portion (in MOBILE) and the server portion (in BACKEND). The idea is that the server will manage tour sessions, where those users that are in an ambassador-led tour in the app will have their tour managed by the ambassador. The ambassador will choose what media those in the group can see by selecting it, they will mark locations as visited and done, and they can edit the tour as needed. Those in the tour-group can do none of these things, but they will be able to see what the ambassador shows them (in the `current location` tab), and will be able to see tour progess. Ask me any questions as needed. I want you to make a list of items we need to accomplish to finish this portion of the project.
