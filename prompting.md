# Handling session starting vs tour starting
I've noticed that you start the tour session when the user first connects using the websocket. I want to change this order. When either user first connects to the websocket (either those in the tour group or the ambassador), I want you to create a tour session with the default status (I've changed it to be 'awaiting_start' instead of 'active'). This should only be done for the first person to join the session. After that, every subsequent member will just join the session that is already started. Where things have been mixed up is that the session being started is different from the tour being started. I only want the tour to be started when the ambassador presses the 'Start Tour' button. Then, we need to update the 'live_tour_sessions' table to have a status of 'active'. This will aslo require you to add an additional 'tour:...' action in TOURSESSIONSJS. I need you to make these updates.
 


This project is for a Campus tour app and supporting services that I am building for my Univserity, but it will be for many schools. I am in the middle of building it at the moment, and I need your help. You can find all the overaching documentation for this project in . I am in the process of handling the ambassador-led tour part of this product. We now need to work on the mobile app side of this portion (which you can find in ). You can find the next tasks we need to tackle under the 'in progess' section of @ambassador-led_kanban.md  . For understanding how the server works and what it expects, make sure to read through @index.js  and @tour-sessions.js  . 


The next part I need to accomplish this is a websocket managed tour that works by the ambassador leading the tour from their phone. I have already handled logging in and account management (both in the webapp and mobile app portion of this project). I am now ready to handle the websocket management of tour sessions. Could you read through this project, particularly the mobile app portion (in MOBILE) and the server portion (in BACKEND). The idea is that the server will manage tour sessions, where those users that are in an ambassador-led tour in the app will have their tour managed by the ambassador. The ambassador will choose what media those in the group can see by selecting it, they will mark locations as visited and done, and they can edit the tour as needed. Those in the tour-group can do none of these things, but they will be able to see what the ambassador shows them (in the `current location` tab), and will be able to see tour progess. Ask me any questions as needed. I want you to make a list of items we need to accomplish to finish this portion of the project.
