# Campus Tour

This project is for a Campus tour app and supporting services that I am building for my Univserity, but it will be for many schools. I am in the middle of building it at the moment, and I need your help. You can find all the overaching documentation for this project in DOCS. I am in the process of handling the ambassador-led tour part of this product. In the mobile app (in MOBILE), I need to start working through the user journey of the ambassador-led tour user. There will be an order of screens that happen after the user selects the "Ambassador-Led" option in INDEXTSX. 

The order of screens will be like this:

- School selection 
  - Use the same screen from the self-guided user journey
- Select tour group 
  - This is a new screen
  - Use the tour group selection screen in TOURGROUPS as a guide 
  - Make it work for mobile of course
- Select Interests
  - Use the same screen from the self-guided user journey
- The map screen / main app view
  - The user shouldn't see the modal pop up that tells them to genereate a tour


## THIS IS JUST THE (I DON'T HAVE A TOUR) JOURNEY


## UT SCHOOL ID: e5a9dfd2-0c88-419e-b891-0a62283b8abd


- Create tour
  - Assign Ambassador
  - Schedule Time
    - Use a maximum of 2 tours per 1 hour block
  -

  - Tour groups are clickable to show more details
  - In details

## TODO

- change how university select is structured so it works better with new setup

# General Ideas with no rhyme or reason

> These are all **maybes**
