I need you to help build an a mobile app. All the important context for the app is in the "docs" folder and in @utah-tech-tour-app-requirements.md. We left off on our task list in @kanban.md on the first task of the "Map Tab Functionality" section. We are going to work one task at a time, and not move on until I tell you the task is done and I mark it done in @kanban.md. Start working on the "Integrate Apple Maps (iOS) / Google Maps (Android)." task.
