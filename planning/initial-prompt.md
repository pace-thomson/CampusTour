I need you to help build an a mobile app. All the important context for the app is in the "docs" folder and in @utah-tech-tour-app-requirements.md. We left off on our task list in @kanban.md on the first task of the "Map Tab Functionality" section. We are going to work one task at a time, and not move on until I tell you the task is done and I mark it done in @kanban.md. Start working on the "Integrate Apple Maps (iOS) / Google Maps (Android)." task.



## For the agent


That looks great! I have made some little changes to the following things that I will list below so you don't overwrite them:

- @map.tsx
    - Background color
    - Text color
    - All of the DEFAULT_REGION values to begin to correctly centered and zooomed
    - The delta values of "setUserLocation"
    - The bottom and right values of recenterButton
    - Header Styling
    - Added a Zoom Out button in the header
  
- @tour.tsx
    - Text color
    - Background color
    - Header styling

- @[id].tsx
    - Background color
    - Header styling
    - Text color

## The next step
I have marked off some steps and got some things done. The next task for us to work on is this: "Handle marker click to navigate to Building Info Page (placeholder)." The context you need for this functionality can be found in `functional-specifications.md`
