That's a great project‚Äîadding an analytics dashboard is a smart move that can give you and your stakeholders real insight into how the campus tour app is being used.

Let‚Äôs break this into phases and talk it through.

## üîç First: What You Want to Track

You've already mentioned some excellent metrics:

1. **Most toured schools**
2. **Most viewed or visited locations (points of interest)**
3. **Popular tour times (days, time of day, seasons)**
4. **User interests or behaviors (what they click on, how long they spend at a location, etc.)**
5. **Tour completion rates or drop-offs**

To get that data, you‚Äôll need to **capture user events**.

## üì• Event Data Capture: How to Log Analytics

Here‚Äôs a list of events you may want to log:

* `tour_started` ‚Äì when a user begins a tour (with school ID, timestamp, maybe user/session ID)
* `location_viewed` ‚Äì when a user views a location (location ID, school ID, timestamp)
* `tour_completed` ‚Äì when a user finishes a tour
* `button_clicked` or `interest_marked` ‚Äì optional, if users can mark places of interest or interact with extra info

### How to Capture This:

You could send this data from the frontend to a **dedicated ‚Äúevents‚Äù table** in Supabase via a simple API call (REST or Supabase client lib). The structure might look like:

```json
{
  "event_type": "location_viewed",
  "school_id": "123",
  "location_id": "456",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-13T15:00:00Z",
  "user_id": "anon_789", // or session_id if anonymous
  "extra_data": {}
}
```

## üõ¢Ô∏è Storage Options

You already use **Supabase**, which makes this easy. You have two main options:

### Option 1: **Add a `tour_events` table** in Supabase

Pros:

* Simple
* No new infrastructure
* Easily queryable from your admin dashboard

Structure example:

| id | event\_type | school\_id | location\_id | user\_id | timestamp | metadata (JSONB) |
| -- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- | ---------------- |

### Option 2: Use a third-party analytics tool (like PostHog or Plausible)

Pros:

* Lots of built-in analytics
* Better dashboards out of the box
  Cons:
* More complex integration
* May not support your custom data structure exactly
* May cost money or feel like overkill

**‚Üí If you want flexibility and control, stick with Option 1.**

## üìä Displaying the Analytics: Admin Dashboard

Once the data is stored in Supabase, your dashboard (probably a simple web frontend) can query Supabase using:

* Aggregations (`COUNT`, `GROUP BY`)
* Filters by time (`WHERE timestamp BETWEEN ...`)
* Charts using something like **Chart.js**, **Recharts**, or **D3.js**

Sample stats you could query:

* **Most toured schools**:

```sql
SELECT school_id, COUNT(*) as tour_count
FROM tour_events
WHERE event_type = 'tour_started'
GROUP BY school_id
ORDER BY tour_count DESC;
```

* **Most popular times**:

```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp) AS day, COUNT(*) 
FROM tour_events 
WHERE event_type = 'tour_started'
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day;
```

* **Popular locations within a school**:

```sql
SELECT location_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM tour_events 
WHERE event_type = 'location_viewed' AND school_id = '123'
GROUP BY location_id
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

## üîí Considerations

### User Tracking

* If users don‚Äôt log in, generate an anonymous user/session ID and store it in `localStorage` or a cookie.

### Privacy & Scale

* Log only what you need. Use `JSONB` for flexible metadata.
* If you get lots of traffic, consider data summarization later (e.g., daily rollups).

## Questions to Fine-Tune This Plan

1. **Do users log in or are they anonymous?** This affects how much personalization you can track.
2. **What frontend framework are you using for the app and the dashboard?**
3. **Do you need real-time analytics, or is ‚Äúupdated every few minutes/hours‚Äù good enough?**
4. **Are you the only admin, or will multiple people view this dashboard?**
5. **Are there any GDPR/FERPA concerns (since it‚Äôs education-related)?**

Once I know a bit more about those, I can help you sketch the schema and code the logging functions or dashboard queries.




# HOW TO QUERY SUPBASE WITH REST:

Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>
```
