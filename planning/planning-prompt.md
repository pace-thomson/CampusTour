# I need your help to build my app

## Overview

I need to build a mobile app for my university (Utah Tech University in St George, Utah) internship, and I need your help building a requirements document for it. I will first tell you the purpose of the app:

## Purpose

The app's purpose is to walk users through a guided tour of our campus. This tour will visit different buildings on campus and show the users what the building's focus is, fun facts, activities, and any other information that would be good for a tour.

## Basic requirements

### Technologies

- React-Native
- Expo

### Tabs

- Map tab
  - Labeled points on it that show campus buildings
  - Points can be clicked on and it will open a building information page
  - Shows the user's location on the map
  - A button that refocuses the map on the user's location
  - Uses apple maps on iOS and Google Maps on Android
- Tour tab
  - Starts by having the user select some of their interests
    - Some example interests
      - Computing
      - Excercise science
      - Rock climbing
      - Medical sciences
      - Arts
      - etc.
    - When they confirm their choices, it adds those stops to the tour
    - They can also skip this section
  - After setting up a tour, it shows the stops in order and what buildings they're at, a picture, etc.
    - Two buttons on each step
      - Details
        - Pulls up the same info page that comes when clicking on a building on the map
      - Location
        - Takes you the map tab and zooms in to the building

## Prompt

This is what I have so far. Can you walk me through making a requirements document in Markdown so I can use an AI agent to build the app? Ask me any clarifying questions so the requirements document can be as complete as possible.
