Map Data:
Q: Are you using a custom campus map, or relying entirely on Apple/Google Maps?
A: For now, I just want to use Apple/Google Maps

Q: How are you planning to get the building coordinates and metadata (name, image, description)?
A: I will create a javascript object myself that has all that information in it. It will be in a file called `locations.js`. You specify what is needed for that data and the format, and I will retrieve it and input it

Tour Stops:
Q: Are all buildings tagged with interest categories?
A: No, some of them will be administration/maintenance buildings

Q: How do you want to sort or sequence the buildings on the tour? Closest first? Custom order?
A: I want to sequence the buildings in a custom order

Offline Use:
Q: Will this app require an internet connection at all times?
A: Ideally the users should have and internet connection for the usage tracking, but it will be possible to use without

User Accounts:
Q: Do users need to log in, or is this app entirely guest-based?
A: It will be entirely guest-based

Analytics or Admin Panel:
Q: Do you want to track usage or customize tour content remotely?
A: I would like to track usage and get that data as much as possible. I would also like the ability to customize tour content remotely

Accessibility Requirements:
Q: Do you need to support screen readers, high contrast mode, etc.?
A: For now, I'm not worried about these features
